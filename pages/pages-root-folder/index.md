        <p>I feel prodigiously flattered to be a part of IEEE circuits and systems (CAS) student chapter.
           CAS has immense requirement in modern era.Research in CAS through years result in the advancement of systems. 
          As a result there is a development of complex,advanced systems;which are used by every industry. 
          It has enormous role in telecommunication,especially in mobiles,IOT devices. This led it into great expansion 
          of concept of “INFORMATION” ranging from data management to many areas.Our student branch goal is to encourage 
          students to learn,research and develop the modern concepts/technologies in this field.Students are nurtured to 
          participate in international conferences,internships and other workshops.This motivate students to collaborate 
          with new and innovative ideas.Eventually,it indulges students to take part in the development of modern systems,
          and also leads to career advancements of students in the field of CAS and contribute for continuous research.</p>
